# 1: Learn Your Daily Driver

1. Check the release notes - what's new? every time i launch Claude Code and a new release is out.
2. Read one documentation page I haven't visited.
3. And here's my power move - I scrape the docs into markdown files
   locally and use Claude Code to chat with them.

## One simple thing to do

1. Go to my PRP repo https://github.com/Wirasm/PRPs-agentic-eng
2. Every thursday take 15 minutes to chat with Claude Code about the latest docs.
3. Hone in on a specific feature or functionality that you're interested in learning more about.
