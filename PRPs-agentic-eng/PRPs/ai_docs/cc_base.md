# Getting started with Claude Code

> Learn how to install, authenticate, and start using Claude Code.

## Check system requirements

* **Operating Systems**: macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 20.04+/Debian 10+, or Windows via WSL
* **Hardware**: 4GB RAM minimum
* **Software**:
  * Node.js 18+
  * [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 2.23+ (optional)
  * [GitHub](https://cli.github.com/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli) CLI for PR workflows (optional)
  * [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) (rg) for enhanced file search (optional)
* **Network**: Internet connection required for authentication and AI processing
* **Location**: Available only in [supported countries](https://www.anthropic.com/supported-countries)

<Note>
  **Troubleshooting WSL installation**

  Currently, Claude Code does not run directly in Windows, and instead requires WSL. If you encounter issues in WSL:

  1. **OS/platform detection issues**: If you receive an error during installation, WSL may be using Windows `npm`. Try:

     * Run `npm config set os linux` before installation
     * Install with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --force --no-os-check` (Do NOT use `sudo`)

  2. **Node not found errors**: If you see `exec: node: not found` when running `claude`, your WSL environment may be using a Windows installation of Node.js. You can confirm this with `which npm` and `which node`, which should point to Linux paths starting with `/usr/` rather than `/mnt/c/`. To fix this, try installing Node via your Linux distribution's package manager or via [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
</Note>

# Core tasks and workflows

> Explore Claude Code's powerful features for editing, searching, testing, and automating your development workflow.

Claude Code operates directly in your terminal, understanding your project
context and taking real actions. No need to manually add files to context -
Claude will explore your codebase as needed.

## Understand unfamiliar code

```
> what does the payment processing system do?
> find where user permissions are checked
> explain how the caching layer works
```

## Automate Git operations

```
> commit my changes
> create a pr
> which commit added tests for markdown back in December?
> rebase on main and resolve any merge conflicts
```

## Edit code intelligently

```
> add input validation to the signup form
> refactor the logger to use the new API
> fix the race condition in the worker queue
```

## Test and debug your code

```
> run tests for the auth module and fix failures
> find and fix security vulnerabilities
> explain why this test is failing
```

## Encourage deeper thinking

For complex problems, explicitly ask Claude to think more deeply:

```
> think about how we should architect the new payment service
> think hard about the edge cases in our authentication flow
```

Claude Code will show when the model is using extended thinking. You can
proactively prompt Claude to "think" or "think deeply" for more
planning-intensive tasks. We suggest that you first tell Claude about your task
and let it gather context from your project. Then, ask it to "think" to create a
plan.

<Tip>
  Claude will think more based on the words you use. For example, "think hard" will trigger more extended thinking than saying "think" alone.

  For more tips, see
  [Extended thinking tips](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Tip>

## Automate CI and infra workflows

Claude Code comes with a non-interactive mode for headless execution. This is
especially useful for running Claude Code in non-interactive contexts like
scripts, pipelines, and Github Actions.

Use `--print` (`-p`) to run Claude in non-interactive mode. In this mode, you
can set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable to provide a custom API
key.

Non-interactive mode is especially useful when you pre-configure the set of
commands Claude is allowed to use:

```sh
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk_...
claude -p "update the README with the latest changes" --allowedTools "Bash(git diff:*)" "Bash(git log:*)" Write --disallowedTools ...
```

# IDE integrations

> Integrate Claude Code with your favorite development environments

Claude Code seamlessly integrates with popular Integrated Development
Environments (IDEs) to enhance your coding workflow. This integration allows you
to leverage Claude's capabilities directly within your preferred development
environment.

## Supported IDEs

Claude Code currently supports two major IDE families:

* **Visual Studio Code** (including popular forks like Cursor and Windsurf)
* **JetBrains IDEs** (including PyCharm, WebStorm, IntelliJ, and GoLand)

## Features

* **Quick launch**: Use `Cmd+Esc` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Esc` (Windows/Linux) to open
  Claude Code directly from your editor, or click the Claude Code button in the
  UI
* **Diff viewing**: Code changes can be displayed directly in the IDE diff
  viewer instead of the terminal. You can configure this in `/config`
* **Selection context**: The current selection/tab in the IDE is automatically
  shared with Claude Code
* **File reference shortcuts**: Use `Cmd+Option+K` (Mac) or `Alt+Ctrl+K`
  (Linux/Windows) to insert file references (e.g., @File#L1-99)
* **Diagnostic sharing**: Diagnostic errors (lint, syntax, etc.) from the IDE
  are automatically shared with Claude as you work

## Installation

### VS Code

1. Open VSCode
2. Open the integrated terminal
3. Run `claude` - the extension will auto-install

Going forward you can also use the `/ide` command in any external terminal to
connect to the IDE.

<Note>
  These installation instructions also apply to VS Code forks like Cursor and
  Windsurf.
</Note>

### JetBrains IDEs

Install the
[Claude Code plugin](https://docs.anthropic.com/s/claude-code-jetbrains) from
the marketplace and restart your IDE.

<Note>
  The plugin may also be auto-installed when you run `claude` in the integrated
  terminal. The IDE must be restarted completely to take effect.
</Note>

<Warning>
  **Remote Development Limitations**: When using JetBrains Remote Development,
  you must install the plugin in the remote host via `Settings > Plugin (Host)`.
</Warning>

## Configuration

Both integrations work with Claude Code's configuration system. To enable
IDE-specific features:

1. Connect Claude Code to your IDE by running `claude` in the built-in terminal
2. Run the `/config` command
3. Set the diff tool to `auto` for automatic IDE detection
4. Claude Code will automatically use the appropriate viewer based on your IDE

If you're using an external terminal (not the IDE's built-in terminal), you can
still connect to your IDE by using the `/ide` command after launching Claude
Code. This allows you to benefit from IDE integration features even when running
Claude from a separate terminal application. This works for both VS Code and
JetBrains IDEs.

<Note>
  When using an external terminal, to ensure Claude has default access to the
  same files as your IDE, start Claude from the same directory as your IDE
  project root.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### VS Code extension not installing

* Ensure you're running Claude Code from VS Code's integrated terminal
* Ensure that the CLI corresponding to your IDE is installed:
  * For VS Code: `code` command should be available
  * For Cursor: `cursor` command should be available
  * For Windsurf: `windsurf` command should be available
  * If not installed, use `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
    and search for "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH" (or the
    equivalent for your IDE)
* Check that VS Code has permission to install extensions

### JetBrains plugin not working

* Ensure you're running Claude Code from the project root directory
* Check that the JetBrains plugin is enabled in the IDE settings
* Completely restart the IDE. You may need to do this multiple times
* For JetBrains Remote Development, ensure that the Claude Code plugin is
  installed in the remote host and not locally on the client

[troubleshooting guide](/en/docs/claude-code/troubleshooting) or reach out to
support.

## Special shortcuts

### Quick memory with `#`

Add memories instantly by starting your input with `#`:

```
# Always use descriptive variable names
```

You'll be prompted to select which memory file to store this in.

### Line breaks in terminal

Enter multiline commands using:

* **Quick escape**: Type `\` followed by Enter
* **Keyboard shortcut**: Option+Enter (or Shift+Enter if configured)

To set up Option+Enter in your terminal:

**For Mac Terminal.app:**

1. Open Settings â Profiles â Keyboard
2. Check "Use Option as Meta Key"

**For iTerm2 and VSCode terminal:**

1. Open Settings â Profiles â Keys
2. Under General, set Left/Right Option key to "Esc+"

**Tip for iTerm2 and VSCode users**: Run `/terminal-setup` within Claude Code to
automatically configure Shift+Enter as a more intuitive alternative.

See [terminal setup in settings](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#line-breaks) for
configuration details.

## Vim Mode

Claude Code supports a subset of Vim keybindings that can be enabled with `/vim`
or configured via `/config`.

The supported subset includes:

* Mode switching: `Esc` (to NORMAL), `i`/`I`, `a`/`A`, `o`/`O` (to INSERT)
* Navigation: `h`/`j`/`k`/`l`, `w`/`e`/`b`, `0`/`$`/`^`, `gg`/`G`
* Editing: `x`, `dw`/`de`/`db`/`dd`/`D`, `cw`/`ce`/`cb`/`cc`/`C`, `.` (repeat)


# Manage Claude's memory

> Learn how to manage Claude Code's memory across sessions with different memory locations and best practices.

Claude Code can remember your preferences across sessions, like style guidelines and common commands in your workflow.

## Determine memory type

Claude Code offers three memory locations, each serving a different purpose:

| Memory Type                | Location              | Purpose                                  | Use Case Examples                                                |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project memory**         | `./CLAUDE.md`         | Team-shared instructions for the project | Project architecture, coding standards, common workflows         |
| **User memory**            | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Personal preferences for all projects    | Code styling preferences, personal tooling shortcuts             |
| **Project memory (local)** | `./CLAUDE.local.md`   | Personal project-specific preferences    | *(Deprecated, see below)* Your sandbox URLs, preferred test data |

All memory files are automatically loaded into Claude Code's context when launched.

## CLAUDE.md imports

CLAUDE.md files can import additional files using `@path/to/import` syntax. The following example imports 3 files:

```
See @README for project overview and @package.json for available npm commands for this project.

# Additional Instructions
- git workflow @docs/git-instructions.md
```

Both relative and absolute paths are allowed. In particular, importing files in user's home dir is a convenient way for your team members to provide individual instructions that are not checked into the repository. Previously CLAUDE.local.md served a similar purpose, but is now deprecated in favor of imports since they work better across multiple git worktrees.

```
# Individual Preferences
- @~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md
```

To avoid potential collisions, imports are not evaluated inside markdown code spans and code blocks.

```
This code span will not be treated as an import: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`
```

Imported files can recursively import additional files, with a max-depth of 5 hops. You can see what memory files are loaded by running `/memory` command.

## How Claude looks up memories

Claude Code reads memories recursively: starting in the cwd, Claude Code recurses up to */* and reads any CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md files it finds. This is especially convenient when working in large repositories where you run Claude Code in *foo/bar/*, and have memories in both *foo/CLAUDE.md* and *foo/bar/CLAUDE.md*.

Claude will also discover CLAUDE.md nested in subtrees under your current working directory. Instead of loading them at launch, they are only included when Claude reads files in those subtrees.

## Quickly add memories with the `#` shortcut

The fastest way to add a memory is to start your input with the `#` character:

```
# Always use descriptive variable names
```

You'll be prompted to select which memory file to store this in.

## Directly edit memories with `/memory`

Use the `/memory` slash command during a session to open any memory file in your system editor for more extensive additions or organization.

## Memory best practices

* **Be specific**: "Use 2-space indentation" is better than "Format code properly".
* **Use structure to organize**: Format each individual memory as a bullet point and group related memories under descriptive markdown headings.
* **Review periodically**: Update memories as your project evolves to ensure Claude is always using the most up to date information and context.
