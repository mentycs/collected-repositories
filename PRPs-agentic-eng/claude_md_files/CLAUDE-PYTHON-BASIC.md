# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Core Principles

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Simplicity should be a key goal in design. Choose straightforward solutions over complex ones whenever possible. Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Avoid building functionality on speculation. Implement features only when they are needed, not when you anticipate they might be useful in the future.

Dependency Inversion: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This principle enables flexibility and testability.

Open/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. Design your systems so that new functionality can be added with minimal changes to existing code.

## 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Functions should be short and focused sub 50 lines of code** and have a single responsibility.
- **Classes should be short and focused sub 50 lines of code** and have a single responsibility.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.

## Architecture
Strict vertical slice architecture with tests that live next to the code they test. 

src/project/
    __init__.py
    main.py
    tests/test_main.py
    conftest.py
    module_one/ (eg. database, core, auth)
        __init__.py
        module_one.py
        tests/
            test_module_one.py
    module_two/ (eg. api, ui, cli)
        __init__.py
        module_two.py
        tests/
            test_module_two.py

    features/ (eg. business logic, tools, etc.)
        feature_one/
            __init__.py
            feature.py
            tests/
                test_feature.py

Features can also be part of moduels if the module for example is a api integration or a cli tool.

eg 
src/project/
    module_one/ (api integration with crm service)
        __init__.py
        module_one.py
        tests/
            test_module_one.py
        features/
            feature_one/ (CRM service integration slice)
                __init__.py
                feature.py
                tests/
                    test_feature.py

## Testing

**Always create Pytest unit tests for new features**
(functions, classes, routes, etc)
Tests are always created in the same directory as the code they test in a tests/ directory. Create the tests directory if it doesn't exist.

**After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it following the implementation.

Always test individual functions and classes.

## Style & Conventions

### 📎 Style & Conventions
- **Use Python** as the primary language.
- **Follow PEP8**, always use type hints, and format with `ruff`.
- **Use `pydanticv2` for data validation**.
- **ALWAYS use classes, data types, data models, for typesafety and verifiability**
- **ALWAYS use docstrings for every function** using the Google style:
  ```python
  def example():
      """
      Brief summary.

      Args:
          param1 (type): Description.

      Returns:
          type: Description.
          
      Raises:
          Exception: Description.
      """
  ```

## 🛠️ Environment Setup

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment with uv
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Install package in development mode
uv pip install -e .
```

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run specific tests
uv run pytest concept_library/full_review_loop/tests/ -v

# Format code
uv run ruff format .

# Run linter
uv run ruff check .

# Run type checker  
uv run mypy .
```

## 🛠️ UV Package Management

This project uses UV for Python package management. Key commands include:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
uv venv

# Install dependencies from pyproject.toml
uv sync

# Install a specific package
uv add requests

# Remove a package
uv remove requests

# Run a Python script or command
uv run python script.py
uv run pytest

# Install editable packages
uv pip install -e .
```

When running scripts or tools, always use `uv run` to ensure proper virtual environment activation:

```bash
# Preferred way to run commands
uv run pytest
uv run black .

# Running tools without installing
uvx black .
uvx ruff check .
```

## 🛠️ BRANCHING STRATEGY

This repository follows a develop → main branching strategy, where:

- `main` is the production branch containing stable releases
- `develop` is the integration branch where features are merged
- Feature branches are created from `develop` for work in progress


When creating branches, follow these naming conventions:

- Feature branches: `feature/descriptive-name`
- Bug fix branches: `fix/issue-description`
- Documentation branches: `docs/what-is-changing`
- Refactoring branches: `refactor/what-is-changing`


## Behavioural Guidelines

- Always use `uv` for package management.
- Always use `ruff` for linting.

- *** NEVER ASSUME OR GUESS ***
- When in doubt, ask for clarification or ask for help. more often than not youcan do websearch to find relevant examples of check ai_docs/ for examples that the user have added. 

- **Always confirm file paths & module names** exist before using them.

- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

- **KEEP README.md UPDATED**
- Whenever you make changes to the codebase, update the README.md file to reflect the changes. Espeially if you add configuration changes or new features.

- **ALWAYS keep CLAUDE.md UPDATED**
- Add new dependencies to CLAUDE.md
- Add important types and patterns to CLAUDE.md
